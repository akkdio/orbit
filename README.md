<h1> Chrome and Safari issue with slider</h1>

<p> The slider "flashes" all the images when you click on a nav, either "Demo" or "Task" in Chrome ( Version 28.0.1500.71) or Safari Version 6.0.5 (8536.30.1)
The slide does not do this in Firfox 22.0 for the MAC. </p>

<p>Anyone with an answer as to how to fix this bug in Chrome or Safari? </p>
